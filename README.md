# Traffic-Sign-Detection-System
The aim of the project is to detect and recognize traffic signs by utilization of synthesized training data, 
which are created from road traffic sign images allowing us to overcome the problems of traffic sign detection databases. 
This method is used for the generation of a database which consists of synthesized pictures to detect traffic signs under different view-light conditions. 
With this data set and a perfect Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can develop a data driven traffic sign recognition 
and detection system which has high detection accuracy and also has high performance ability in training and recognition processes. 
TSRS (Traffic Sign Recognition System) may play a significant role in the self-driving car, artificial driver assistance.
